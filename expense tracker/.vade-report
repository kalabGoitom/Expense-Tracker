# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the expense tracker HTML application.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- **index.html** - Added Vercel Web Analytics tracking script

## Implementation Details

Since this is a plain HTML project (no build system or JavaScript framework), I followed the HTML-specific instructions from the Vercel Web Analytics guide:

1. Added the initialization script that creates the `window.va` function
2. Added the deferred loading script that loads from `/_vercel/insights/script.js`

The scripts were added in the `<head>` section, right before the closing `</head>` tag, which ensures they load with the page but don't block rendering.

### Code Added
```html
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

## Notes

- No package installation required for plain HTML implementation
- The analytics will automatically start tracking visitors and page views once deployed to Vercel
- The `/_vercel/insights/view` endpoint will be available after deployment to Vercel
- No route support is available with the HTML implementation (as noted in the guide)
- To verify the implementation is working, check the browser's Network tab for a Fetch/XHR request to `/_vercel/insights/view` after deployment

## Next Steps for the User

1. Deploy the app to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by connecting the Git repository
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
3. Once deployed and users visit the site, view analytics data in the Vercel dashboard
4. Optionally, explore custom events for tracking specific user interactions (requires Pro or Enterprise plan)

## Important
The analytics tracking will only work when the app is deployed to Vercel. Local development will not send analytics data (or will send to development mode if configured).
